            <p class="text-center">Our guiding principle is to provide the highest quality professional services on a timely basis at a reasonable charge. Our professional fees usually are based on the actual amount of time expended on a project, which generally is determined by the difficulty of the project. It is our practice to apportion projects or parts of projects among persons in the office who are capable of performing the work at the lowest billing rate. We often find that utilizing the assistance of well-trained paralegals is cost-effective for our clients.</p>
            <p class="text-center">We generally bill our clients in the subsequent month when a significant amount of services are rendered during the previous month. When requested, we can and do give advance estimates of expected costs. We recognize that our clients must be kept informed regularly of the progress of the matters they have entrusted to us. Our firm has a policy of regular client communication in which the client is provided with periodic information and copies of appropriate documents concerning the progress of each case.</p>
